I've recently started a new role. We've decided to work with full stack JavaScript for both front and back end. See our 
[stack share](https://stackshare.io/mind-gym/mind-gym) if you want more details. This presents a challenge for me if I 
want to stay close to the code as it's been years since I've worked full stack and I've never worked with JavaScript in 
any detail. 

As I'm not a day-in day-out engineer this means I need a hobby project

This is the `coding.blog` for [Dave Lush](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-lush-9aba716/). I've dabbled with pieces of 
content on my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@dave.lush) over the past few years but the mission statement for 
https://coding.blog/ has grabbed me.

I'm here to give it a try 👍

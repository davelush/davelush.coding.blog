Every blog needs to start somewhere right? Rather than the usual `welcome to my blog` I thought I'd write a little about:

* My personal journey through software engineering
* Why I've decided to invest some time and effort into https://coding.blog

## My Journey Till Now

My journey through software engineering started with a teacher called Mr Overend somewhere around 1988 (you were a 
massive early influence). He saw the potential in computing and encouraged a small group of us to learn the BASIC
programming language on a classroom BBC model B. I remember making 8 bit sprites with an array of 8 x 8 bit numbers,
encoding midi audio with a sequence of numbers, using a loop and keyboard input to make those sprites move around. I
remember him trying to educate me on data structures and it stretching my 8 year old brain beyond what it was capable of.
I finally remember doodling new sprites on an 8x8 grid and working out the numbers that would paint the picture. I used
to rush through school work in order to get my hands on the computer.

From there I went through a mispent youth, on into art & graphic design until re-approaching computers with a CS degree 
around 19 years old. I bounced off this pretty hard and didn't really enjoy it. Too much maths, too much theory and not 
enough applying myself. A couple of years later I started again with a Cybernetics degree (thank you Dad for the nudge). 
Now this really hit the spot! University went from dry theory to applied programming, robotics, electronics, control-systems
and the psychology of technology use.

Perhaps unusually, I'd not going to go into a lot of detail on my technical career. It can be summarised as:
 
* Some full stack
* Lots of backend Java and Spring
* Lots of test automation, continuous delivery and devops
* 3 years of Python
* Quite a lot of reading other people's code in a variety of languages

## Why Here?

Sticking with the ethos of `coding.blog` though, I'm not here to sell myself or my career. 

I'm here to enjoy writing about my love for coding, any little projects I have on the go and to pay my knowledge forward 
into the next generation of software engineers. 

I really *really* like the mission statement of `coding.blog` (if that's what it is?)

```
Quality. Articles. About. Coding.
``` 

I really like the blog authoring and publishing method too. 

I hope the team accumulate minimal costs and can afford to keep the platform advert free.
